# Testing
Throughout the entire development, testing was ongoing. Throughout the development process, I used Google's Developer Tools to check that everything was operating as expected and and carried out debugging when necessary. I used both manual testing and automated testing using unit test. Majority of the website is validated with automated testing. Due to time constraints only small portion of the site was not tested with automated testing.
