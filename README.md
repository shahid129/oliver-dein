## Web Marketing
The use of social media marketing is probably essential for drawing customers and increasing visibility. The best way to generate interest is probably through an organic approach as the marketing budget will probably be little at first.

Marketing on social media platforms other than Facebook, such as Instagram, Pinterest, and YouTube, is advantageous. Because Facebook marketing is more important than any other platform, I will use it for the purposes of this project.Â
