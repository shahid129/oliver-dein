![Main Page](docs/screenshot/others/site-main-page.png)

Oliver Dein is an internet store where customers may purchase any kind of household goods. The website utilises Stripe as the payment processor.
This example project was not created to simulate actual credit card transactions. Use the test card number 4242 4242 4242 4242 with any future expiration date, any three-digit CVC, and any five-digit zip code to test the functionality.

## Site Goals
- Site owners aim
    - Site owners can easily sell their products.
    - Site owners add or update their products.

## Web Marketing
The use of social media marketing is probably essential for drawing customers and increasing visibility. The best way to generate interest is probably through an organic approach as the marketing budget will probably be little at first.

Marketing on social media platforms other than Facebook, such as Instagram, Pinterest, and YouTube, is advantageous. Because Facebook marketing is more important than any other platform, I will use it for the purposes of this project.Â 
The live face book page can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100089334735487). If the site is no longer available an image can be found [here](docs/screenshot/FB_page_1.png) and [here](docs/screenshot/FB_page_2.png).


## Search Engine Optimaisation
The meta keywords and description in the site's base.html have been updated to reflect the researches keywords. On significant pages like the index and product pages, the site title has the name Oliver Dein and also contains key keywords.

The homepage has also been designed with SEO in mind. Some of the keywords are also used in the text portions of the webpage, with strong tags surrounding the significant ones. For SEO purposes, a sitemap.xml and robots.txt file have also been added.

# Planning
## User Story
The plan for this project was carried out using the Agile Methodology in Github. User Stories were created using the issues on the git hub. Each user story explicitly explains the purpose of the issues. Each user story is segmented into acceptance criteria and tasks. It was prioritised using GitHub labels with different colors. Once the issues are created they are moved to the User Stories kanban board. The Kanban board has three main columns, To Do, In Progress and Done. Once you start working with the user story, you move it to the To Do column and when finished move it to the Done column. Following this pattern of work gives you a full-on idea about the progress of the project.


The epics were created using the milestones on github. Each epic was created and related issues were added to it. A time frame was added to make sure the tasks were done on time.

## Design
The website is created to draw users' attention and be easy to use, making it possible for an user to browse and buy things of interest quickly. In order to plan the site's layout, wireframes for desktop, tablet, and mobile views were made and only few colors were used to maintain consistency of the website.

- ## Color Schema

The color palette for this project was kept as simple as possible in order to maintain the contrast between the background and the foreground.

![](docs/screenshot/others/colors.png)

- ## Model Schema

Two relational databases were used to create the site. The built in Django SQLite database was used for development and then Postgres for the deployed version. The site is based around a number of models separated into the following main groups.

**Product Models**

**Category** - stores the details of a product category.

- **Product** - stores all the details about a product for sale. Connected to the featured product, recently added products and Category objects via foreign key relationships.

- **Review / Comments** - stores a user review of a product and is connected to the Product and by foreign key relationships.

**User Models**

- **User** - the Django Allauth user model containing information such as username and password.

- **Profile** - stores a users default delivery information and is connected to the User via a one to one relationship.

**Order Models**
- **Order** - a foreign key relationship connects the user profile to the storage of the complete order data.

- **OrderLineItem** - stores the product information for a single product purchased on an order. Foreign key relationships connect the product and order.

Two additional models providing general information for the site user or store owner have also been used.

- **Contact** - stores a site user message submitted through the contact form.
- **FAQ** - stores FAQ questions and answers that the store owner has added to the site.
