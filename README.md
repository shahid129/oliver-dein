## Web Marketing
The use of social media marketing is probably essential for drawing customers and increasing visibility. The best way to generate interest is probably through an organic approach as the marketing budget will probably be little at first.

Marketing on social media platforms other than Facebook, such as Instagram, Pinterest, and YouTube, is advantageous. Because Facebook marketing is more important than any other platform, I will use it for the purposes of this project.Â

## Search Engine Optimaisation
The meta keywords and description in the site's base.html have been updated to reflect the researches keywords. On significant pages like the index and product pages, the site title has the name Oliver Dein and also contains key keywords.

The homepage has also been designed with SEO in mind. Some of the keywords are also used in the text portions of the webpage, with strong tags surrounding the significant ones. For SEO purposes, a sitemap.xml and robots.txt file have also been added.

# Planning
## User Story
The plan for this project was carried out using the Agile Methodology in Github. User Stories were created using the issues on the git hub. Each user story explicitly explains the purpose of the issues. Each user story is segmented into acceptance criteria and tasks. It was prioritised using GitHub labels with different colors. Once the issues are created they are moved to the User Stories kanban board. The Kanban board has three main columns, To Do, In Progress and Done. Once you start working with the user story, you move it to the To Do column and when finished move it to the Done column. Following this pattern of work gives you a full-on idea about the progress of the project.


The epics were created using the milistones on github. Each epic was created and related issues were added to it. A time frame was added to make sure the tasks were done on time.
